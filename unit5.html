    <u><h1>Introduction to Google Analytics and digital Marketing</h1></u>
    <ul><li>
        Google Analytics is a web analytics service that provides statistics and basic analytical tools for search engine optimization (SEO) and marketing purposes. It is a free service that can help organizations track website performance, collect visitor insights, determine top sources of user traffic, gauge the success of their marketing activities and campaigns, track goal completions, discover patterns and trends in user engagement, and obtain other visitor information such as demographics. Google Analytics includes features that enable data collection, analysis, monitoring, visualization, reporting, and integration with other applications. Some of the features include data visualization and monitoring tools, data filtering, manipulation and funnel analysis, data collection APIs, predictive analytics, intelligence and anomaly detection, segmentation for analysis of subsets, custom reports for advertising, acquisition, audience behavior and conversion, email-based sharing and communication, and integration with other products such as Google Ads, Google Data Studio, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Google AdSense, Google Optimize 360, Google Search Ads 360, Google Display & Video 360, and Google Search Console. Google Analytics 4 is the most recent iteration of this service and was released in October 2020. It offers a completely new user interface and shifts from reliance on third-party cookies toward the use of machine learning. Google Analytics can provide businesses with multiple types of data for marketing purposes, including user acquisition data and user behavior data. User acquisition data provides insight into how customers are arriving at the website, while user behavior data shows what customers are doing on the website, including how long they spend on each page, how many pages they visit, and if they engage with videos and graphics. Google Analytics allows customers to monitor up to 200 metrics in order to assess the performance of their websites.
