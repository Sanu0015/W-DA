    <strong> <u><h1> History of www </u> </strong> </h1>
	<ul><li>
	The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, in 1989 while working at CERN. The Web was originally developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in CERN, which is an extensive community of scientists from over 100 countries. By the end of 1990, the first Web server and browser were up and running at CERN, and the first Web page address was. The development of the WWW was further accelerated by the release of the Mosaic browser in 1993, which allowed users to use "point-and-click" graphical manipulations. The early web community produced revolutionary ideas such as decentralization and open access, leading to the founding of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994. This decision sparked a global wave of creativity, collaboration, and innovation. In 2014, almost two in five people around the world were using the Web, and in the same year, the companies developing new web standards committed to a Royalty Free Policy for their work.</li></ul>
	
	<strong><u><h1> Evolution of Html</u></strong></h1>
	<ul>
	<li>HTML, the markup language used to create web pages, has evolved through various versions since its inception. Here is a brief overview of its evolution:<br>

<strong>- HTML 1.0 (1993):</strong> The first version of HTML was released in 1993, providing the basic structure and elements for creating web pages. It consisted of 18 tags and was intended to share information readable and accessible via web browsers.<br>

<strong>- HTML 2.0 (1995):</strong> This version contained all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features. It remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until 1997.<br>

<strong>- HTML 3.0 (1997):</strong> Introduced a fresh draft on HTML with improved new features, providing more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing websites. However, the powerful features slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.<br>

<strong>- HTML 4.01 (1999):</strong> This was a widely used and successful version of HTML, introducing advancements such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for improved control over page styling, enhanced support for scripting, and multimedia elements.<br>

<strong>- HTML 5.0 (2014):</strong> HTML 5 can be considered an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in 2012. It marked a significant milestone in web development, introducing a wide range of new elements and attributes, improved multimedia support, and better compatibility with mobile devices.<br>

HTML has continued to evolve, and its various versions have unfurled new possibilities, pushing the boundaries of creativity, connectivity, and user experience.
</li>
</ul>
<strong><u><h1>Different Html Versions</u></strong></h1>
<ul><li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is an evolving language with different versions supporting different features, and each new version is given a version number. The first version of HTML did not have a version number and was just called HTML. The major versions of HTML include HTML 2.0, released in 1995, which was the standard for website design until January 1997 and defined many core HTML features for the first time. HTML 3.2 was finalized by the W3C in early 1997 and included support for creating tables and expanded options for form elements. HTML 4.01 is the current official standard, released in December 1999, and added support for style sheets and scripting ability for multimedia elements. HTML5 is still a work in progress, and all major browsers support many of the new HTML5 elements and APIs. Its core aim has been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices.
</li></ul>

<strong><u><h1> Why Html5</u></strong></h1>
<ul>

<strong><u><h1> HTML4 vs HTML5 </u></strong></h1>
<ul><li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating and structuring web pages. HTML4 and HTML5 are two different versions of the HTML specification, with HTML5 being the latest and more modern version. Here are some key differences between HTML4 and HTML5:<br>

<strong>1. DOCTYPE Declaration:</strong><br>
  <strong> - HTML4:</strong> Requires a strict document type declaration at the beginning of the HTML document.<br>
  <strong> - HTML5:</strong>Simplifies the doctype declaration to `&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;`, making it more straightforward.<br>

<strong>2. Syntax:</strong><br>
   <strong>- HTML4:</strong> Has a more rigid syntax and is less forgiving of errors. It may not display properly if there are minor mistakes in the code.<br>
   <strong>- HTML5:</strong> Has a more lenient syntax and is designed to be more forgiving. It can handle minor errors more gracefully, making it easier for developers.<br>

<strong>3. New Elements:</strong><br>
   <strong>- HTML4:</strong> Lacks several modern elements that are available in HTML5, such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;, and &lt;figcaption&gt;.<br>
   <strong>- HTML5:</strong> Introduces new semantic elements that provide better structure and meaning to the content of a web page.<br>

<strong>4. Multimedia:</strong><br>
  <strong> - HTML4:</strong> Relies on plugins like Adobe Flash for multimedia content.<br>
   <strong>- HTML5:</strong> Supports native multimedia elements like `&lt;audio&gt;` and `&lt;video&gt;`, reducing the dependence on third-party plugins.<br>

<strong>5. Graphics:</strong><br>
  <strong> - HTML4:</strong> Requires the use of external technologies like SVG or Canvas for advanced graphics.<br>
  <strong> - HTML5:</strong> Introduces the `&lt;svg&gt;` element for scalable vector graphics and the `&lt;canvas&gt;` element for dynamic rendering of graphics and images.<br>

<strong>6. Form Elements:</strong><br>
  <strong> - HTML4:</strong> Limited form controls and validation options.<br>
   <strong>- HTML5:</strong> Introduces new form input types (`&lt;input type="email"&gt;`, `&lt;input type="date"&gt;`, etc.) and attributes for more advanced form handling and validation.<br>

<strong>7. APIs:</strong><br>
  <strong> - HTML4:</strong> Lacks modern APIs for offline web applications, geolocation, drag-and-drop, and more.<br>
   <strong>- HTML5: </strong>Includes various new APIs, such as the Geolocation API, Web Storage API, Web Workers API, and the Drag and Drop API.<br>

<strong>8. Compatibility:</strong><br>
   <strong>- HTML4:</strong> Designed in an era when the web was less dynamic and interactive.<br>
  <strong> - HTML5:</strong> Adapted to the current needs of the web, with a focus on multimedia, interactivity, and improved semantics.<br>

In summary, HTML5 is a more feature-rich and flexible version of HTML, designed to meet the demands of modern web development. It introduces new elements, attributes, and APIs, making it easier for developers to create interactive and multimedia-rich web applications.</li></ul>

</li>
</ul>
<strong><u><h1> Browser support </u> </strong></h1>
<ul><li> The browser support for various web technologies and features can be checked using different resources. One such resource is "Can I use" (caniuse.com), which provides support tables for HTML5, CSS3, and other web technologies. Additionally, Google provides information on supported browsers for signing in and using its services, emphasizing the importance of using a supported browser and enabling JavaScript for security reasons. Furthermore, developers can find information on supported browsers and platforms for Google sign-in and other features on the Google Developers website. For specific web technologies like CSS, the W3Schools website offers a CSS Browser Support Reference, detailing the support for CSS properties in different browsers. Moreover, Mozilla's Developer Network (MDN) provides information on browser support for various JavaScript APIs. These resources can help developers ensure the compatibility of their web content and applications across different browsers and platforms.
</li>
</ul>
<strong><u> <h1>Backward compatibility </u></strong></h1>
<ul><li>Backward compatibility in the context of HTML5 refers to the ability of the language to support existing web content and applications, ensuring that they continue to function properly even as new features are introduced. HTML5 is designed to be as backward compatible as possible with existing web browsers. New features build on existing ones and allow for the provision of fallback content for older browsers. This means that while HTML5 introduces new capabilities, it also ensures that existing web content and applications remain functional. However, it's important to note that even HTML5-aware web browsers do not support the HTML5 specification perfectly, so providing some form of backward compatibility with all HTML5 features is necessary to avoid alienating users based on their choice of web browser.</li></ul>
